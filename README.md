# Aura Farming ✨

*A real-time “aura” visualizer that detects emotions from your face and renders a glowing halo around you — using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and DeepFace / FER.*

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects emotions in real time using:
  - [FER](https://github.com/justinshenk/fer) (fast, lightweight)
  - [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) (more accurate, slower)
- Dynamic glowing aura around the user’s silhouette.
- Smooth color transitions based on detected emotion.
- Adjustable aura size, intensity & pulse animation.
- Option to switch models on the fly (`m` key).
- Save a screenshot of the current frame (`s` key).
- Modular code structure for easier debugging and updates.
